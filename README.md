# Titanic-Data-Set
Here I implemented logistic regression to the Titanic Data Set, to try and predict whether individuals on board were likely to survive or not, depending on a number of variables. 
I started with a little bit of EDA, setting myself 5 key questions. These surrounded percentage of survival, gender and class splits. 
After this initial EDA I jumped into cleaning the data. Most of the cleaning was making sure I had no nulls. I had to implament some averages if certain data points were missing. 
I ran my logistic regression on 6 variables first, then I dropped columns and focused on 4 variables. 
My model predicted all who survived and all who didn't.

I set myself this challenge for the well known kaggle competition.
